# NBA_Management_APP

An NBA organization requires a small application to manage its teams, players, coaches, games, and sponsors. Each team has a name, a coach, a roster of players, a list of sponsors, and a record of their games and statistics. 
Each player has a profile with statistics, a salary, and is assigned to a team. Coaches have information about their teams and strategies, and sponsors are associated with teams and provide financial support.
The application allows the addition of players to teams. If a team has reached its maximum roster size, the user receives a warning and must select a different team or remove an existing player.
The application displays teams with their rosters, available player slots, and sponsor details.
Users can view all players assigned to a particular team and access their individual statistics.
The application allows viewing of all games played, with results and statistics for each game.
Each player’s salary is managed within the application, ensuring that team payrolls comply with league salary caps. If a salary increase exceeds the cap, the user is alerted, and the increase is disallowed.
Any change in a player's statistics is automatically reflected in the team's overall statistics.
Coaches can modify their team’s strategies, and these strategies can be updated as players are added or removed from the team.
